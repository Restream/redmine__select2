This plugin adds [Select2 3.4.0] (https://select2.github.io/) to Redmine.

## Compatibility

This plugin version is compatible only with Redmine 2.1.x and later.

## Installation

1. To install the plugin
    * Download the .ZIP archive, extract files and copy the plugin directory into #{REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins.
    
    Or

    * Change you current directory to your Redmine root directory:  

            cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
            
      Copy the plugin from GitHub using the following commands:
      
            git clone https://github.com/Undev/redmine__select2.git plugins/redmine__select2
            
2. Install the required gems using the command:  

        bundle install  

    * In case of bundle install errors, remove the Gemfile.lock file, update the local package index and install the required dependencies. Then execute the `bundle install` command again:  

            rm Gemfile.lock
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libpq-dev
            bundle install
            
3. Restart Redmine.
